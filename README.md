# RDMS

## Running `cmake`

```
mkdir build
cd build

cmake ..

`

Then you will find `aout` file inside the build directory

`./aout` will run the tests for you. 


You don't need to worry about anything.

- using the database class, you can create tables
- and `tables.getRelation()` returns set of Tuples
- based on that you can implement the operations
